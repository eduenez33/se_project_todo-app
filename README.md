# Simple Todo App

This is a straightforward todo application built with Javascript, utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Users can create todo items, each featuring a title, an optional due date, and a convenient delete button for easy management of tasks.

## Functionality

* **Task Creation:** Users can easily add new tasks to their todo list. Each new todo item requires a **title**, providing a clear description of the task at hand.
* **Optional Due Dates:** To help with organization and deadlines, users have the option to associate a **due date** with each todo item. This allows for better prioritization and tracking of time-sensitive tasks.
* **Task Removal:** Each created todo item features a dedicated **delete button**. Clicking this button provides a quick and intuitive way for users to remove completed or unwanted tasks from their list, keeping it clean and relevant.

**Under the Hood (OOP Practices):**

* **Todo Items as Objects:** Each individual todo task is represented as an object, encapsulating its data and its behavior.
* **Classes for Structure:** Defined classes to serve as blueprints for creating todo items. This promotes code reusability and a logical organization of the application's components.
* **Encapsulation:** The data and methods related to a todo item are bundled together within the `Todo` object, controlling access and preventing unintended modifications.


## Technology

* **Javascript:** The primary programming language used for building the application's logic and dynamic behavior within the web browser. This includes handling user interactions, manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), and managing the application's state.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** A programming paradigm employed to structure the application's code around "objects," which bundle data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data. Key OOP principles utilized in this project include:
    * Encapsulation
    * Abstraction
* **DOM Manipulation:** Javascript is used to dynamically update the structure, style, and content of the web page (the DOM) in response to user actions.
* **Event Handling:** Javascript event listeners are used to detect and respond to user interactions, such as clicking buttons.
